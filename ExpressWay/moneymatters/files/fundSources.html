          <p class="hppghdr"><img src="../../imglib/new/fundSources.jpg" width="640" height="100"></p>
          <p align="left"><strong> </strong>Every citizen in the State of Texas who owns, operates, and maintains a vehicle or pays federal taxes contributes to the construction and maintenance of the state transportation system. If you fill your tank with gasoline, register your vehicle, purchase motor oil, or change a vehicle title, you are contributing to transportation construction in the state of Texas through taxes and fees. </p>
          <p align="left">The taxes and fees paid by Texas citizens can flow through both the federal and state government, depending on the type of payment. All funds designated for the state transportation system eventually go through the state government and TxDOT, then to your local TxDOT district, where it is returned in the form of construction, maintenance, and improved safety of your roadways, as prioritized by you and other citizens through your Metropolitan Planning Organization. A continuous cycle is created that helps to provide all of us with an efficient and effective road system in our state. </p>
          <p align="left"><strong><em>Receipts</em></strong></p>
          <p align="left">TxDOT receives its transportation funds from various sources. These are primarily the State Highway Fund, motor fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees, and federal reimbursements.</p>
          <p align="left">Construction and maintenance of the state highway system is paid out of the <a href="../distnTotReceipts.htm">State Highway Fund</a>. In Fiscal Year 2002, the State Highway Fund received $5.75 billion. Thirty-five cents of every dollar came from the <span class="style3"><a href="../distnMotorFuelTaxes.htm">motor fuel tax</a></span>, 13 cents from <span class="style2 style3"><a href="../distnMotorVehReg.htm">vehicle registrations and title fees</a></span>, 1 cent from sales tax on lubricants, 45 cents through federal reimbursements, and 6 cents from local participation.</p>
          <p align="left">Monthly <a href="http://www.dot.state.tx.us/moneymatters/moneymatters.htm?pg=fedrefund">federal reimbursements</a> are conducted through Fund 006, a state cash management program. Contractors doing work on state roads and facilities are paid by TxDOT which, in turn, bills the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) who then reimburses TxDOT through Fund 006 for 80% of the payment to the contractor. In Fiscal year 2002, TxDOT received over $2.6 billion in federal reimbursements for transportation work.</p>
          <p align="left"> A new source of revenue for the department is the <a href="http://www.dot.state.tx.us/txdotnews/txmobilfundplan.htm">Texas Mobility Fund</a>. It allows TxDOT to accelerate needed transportation improvements statewide to reduce congestion, improve safety and expand economic development and to maximize the effectiveness of limited transportation dollars. The department can issue bonds secured by future revenue to accelerate mobility projects throughout the state. The bonds can be used to pay for construction, reconstruction, expanding and acquiring state highways, state participation in toll projects and other public transportation projects, refunding, issuance costs, establishing reserve accounts, and paying interest.</p>
          <p align="left">In the future, TxDOT will receive more revenue from toll roads. These roads provide an opportunity to increase the amount of available revenue faster and will lead to increased construction of roads in the state. The Texas Transportation Commission has also stressed the importance of developing toll roads as a way to deliver transportation improvements faster. Traditional funding sources can no longer be the sole source to meet the state's growing transportation demands. Tolling can complement existing funding sources and speed congestion relief.</p>
          <p align="left">Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles (GARVEE) enable states to pay debt service and other bond-related expenses with future Federal-aid highway apportionments. It is a debt financing instrument authorized to receive Federal reimbursement of debt service and related financing costs. GARVEEs can be issued by a state, a political subdivision of a state, or a public authority.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong><em>Disbursements </em></strong></p>
          <p align="left">TxDOT disbursed $5.6 billion in funds in order to achieve its objective of providing for the safe, effective, and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the state of Texas. To achieve these goals, TxDOT utilizes five strategies in its approach to the state transportation system. The five strategies are: </p>
          <div align="left"><ul><li>Plan It </li>
                <li> Build It </li>
                <li> Maintain It </li>
                <li> Use It </li>
                <li> Manage It </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p align="left"><em>Plan It</em> encompasses all of the planning and environmental design of transportation projects. In FY2002, planning functions within the department received 17 cents of every dollar disbursed.</p>
          <p align="left"><em>Build It</em> oversees construction projects that add capacity to the state transportation system. This strategy received 30 cents of every dollar disbursed.</p>
          <p align="left">Existing transportation investments must remain safe and usable. The <em>Maintain It</em> strategy sought to do this by receiving 40 cents of every dollar disbursed in FY2002.</p>
          <p align="left">The <em>Use It</em> strategy ensures that citizens are using the transportation system safely and efficiently. Numerous programs provide this, such as issuing motor vehicle titles and registration documents, regulating motor vehicle dealers, and improving public safety. This strategy received 3 cents of every dollar disbursed.</p>
          <p align="left">The state transportation system must be administered by dedicated employees who have the training, information resources, and management resources required for a state like Texas. The <em>Manage It</em> strategy received 3 cents of every dollar disbursed in FY2002. </p>
          <p align="left">The Department of Public Safety and other state agencies received 7 cents for each dollar disbursed from the State Highway Fund.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong><em>State Infrastructure Banks (SIB) </em></strong></p>
          <p align="left">State Infrastructure Banks (SIB) were authorized by Congress in 1995 as a part of the National Highway Designation Act to provide an innovative financing tool to more rapidly build needed mobility improvements. The state legislature authorized the TxDOT to administer the SIB program in 1997.</p>
          <p align="left">The overall goal of the SIB program is to provide innovative financing methods that will add to the list of options available to communities to assist them in meeting their infrastructure needs. The SIB program allows borrowers to access capital funds at or lower-than-market interest rates. The SIB operates as a revolving loan fund, where the account balance grows through the monthly interest earned and repaid principal and interest payments.</p>
          <p align="left">For more information on the SIB program, including current loan information and applications, click <a href="sib.html">here</a>.</p>
