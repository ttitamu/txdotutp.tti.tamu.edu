          <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
          <p>This category addresses the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard in the non-attainment areas of the state. Projects pertain to congestion mitigation and air quality improvement (CMAQ) in the non-attainment areas in the state. </p>
          <p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>
          <p>CMAQ projects are selected by the MPO in consultation with TxDOT and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Projects must have final approval by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) before letting. </p>
          <p>Each CMAQ project is evaluated to quantify its air quality improvement benefits. </p>
          <p>Funds can not be used to add capacity for single occupancy vehicles. </p>
          <p>All projects must be developed in accordance with applicable federal or state environmental requirements. </p>
          <p>All projects must be designed, constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with state laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design and construction standards as required by TEA-21 or its successor legislation.</p>
          <p><strong>Allocation to Districts</strong><strong></strong></p>
          <p>Each nonattainment area receives an annual allocation to expend. Allocations are based on population and air quality non-attainment factors outlined in TEA-21. </p>
          <p>The program is managed by the MPO as an allocation program with eligible projects developed by the districts on an as-needed basis. Projects can be canceled or changed as long as the program balance is not exceeded; however there are ramifications for air quality planning for the nonattainment area from any project change or cancellation. </p>
          <p>Additional programming authority has also been allocated to the districts for the development of plans, specifications, estimates and right-of-way purchase. Funding of these projects can be made through upcoming CMAQ programs.</p>
          <p><strong>Policy</strong><strong></strong></p>

          <p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>
          <p>Projects are selected by the MPO in consultation with the districts. This program authority can be used on any roadway with a functional classification greater than a local road or rural minor collector.</p>
          <p>All projects must be developed in accordance with the applicable federal and state environmental requirements. All projects must also be designed, constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with state laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design and construction standards as required by TEA-21 or its successor legislation. </p>
          <p><strong>Allocation to Districts</strong><strong></strong></p>
          <p>Each urbanized area with a population of at least 200,000 receives an annual allocation to expend. Allocations are based on population and distributed to TxDOT districts. </p>
          <p>The program is managed as an allocation program, and eligible projects (selected by the MPO) are developed by the districts on an as-needed basis. Projects can be canceled or changed as long as the program balance is not exceeded. </p>
          <p>Additional programming authority has also been allocated to the districts for the development of plans, specifications, estimates and right-of-way purchase. Funding of these projects can be made through upcoming Metropolitan Mobility/Rehabilitation programs.</p>

          <p><strong><a name="safety"></a>SAFETY</strong><strong></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
          <p>This category is composed of the following TxDOT safety programs: Federal Hazard Elimination Program and the Federal Railroad Signal Safety Program. TEA-21 provides that 10 percent of all the Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds apportioned to the state be dedicated to safety projects. </p>
          <p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>
          <p>Safety funds apportioned under the Federal Hazard Elimination Program are to be used to implement highway safety improvement projects on any public road other than an Interstate. Safety funds apportioned under the Federal Railroad Signal Safety Program are to be used to implement highway-rail grade crossing safety projects on any public road. Safety funds apportioned under the Federal Hazard Elimination Program or the Federal Railroad Signal Safety Program can also be used to develop a crash records information system. </p>
          <p>All projects must be developed in accordance with applicable federal and state environmental requirements. All projects must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with state laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design and construction standards as required by TEA-21 or its successor legislation. </p>
          <p><strong>Project Selection</strong><strong></strong></p>
          <p>Allocations for the safety programs are approved by the Commission. The programs are managed as allocation programs on a statewide basis. Projects are evaluated, ranked, prioritized and selected by the Traffic Operations Division. </p>
          <p>TxDOT districts and divisions receive program authority for the projects selected for inclusion in a safety program. The Federal Hazard Elimination Program is usually a one-year program with the program funds available for use within three years. The Federal Railroad Signal Safety Program is usually a one-year program with the program funds available for use within four years.</p>
          <p><strong>Policy</strong> </p>
          <p>Federal Hazard Elimination Program projects are evaluated and ranked by a safety improvement index using three years of accident data. </p>
          <p>All highway-rail crossings on the statewide inventory are prioritized using the Texas Priority Index (PI). This index is based on the number of trains per day, speed of trains, current average daily traffic, number of school bus crossings per day (special vehicles), type of warning devices, and train involved accidents within the prior five years. Those crossings with the highest PI are selected for the Federal Railroad Signal Safety Program. </p>
          <p>Funds for a crash records information system will be approved by the Executive Director (or designee). </p>
          <p>Match for preliminary engineering, construction, and right-of-way purchase/utility adjustments will be in accordance with TxDOT's Policy for Matching Funds - Participation Ratios. </p>
