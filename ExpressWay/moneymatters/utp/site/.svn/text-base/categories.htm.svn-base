              Rehabilitation (Category 1)</u><br>
 Roads in Texas have to be maintained at a high level and, in cases where the
 road has serious problems, improvements must be made. These types of work are
 funded by this category. Maintenance and rehabilitation funds are used on roads
 served by TxDOT and may be used for rehabilitation of the Interstate Highway
 System, frontage roads, structures, rehabilitation of road signs, pavement markings,
 striping, etc. The Transportation Planning and Programming Division of TxDOT
 may approve the use of rehabilitation funds for the construction of highway
 interchanges and HOV lanes on the Interstate Highway System. Funds in this category
 may <em>not </em> be used for the construction of new lanes that would have
 primarily single passenger vehicles on them. Preventive Maintenance and Rehabilitation
 funding is distributed regionally by formula by the Texas Transportation Commission,
 with projects selected by TxDOT districts, including yours. For more detail on the Preventive Maintenance and Rehabilitation category, click <a href="SPP.Detail.htm#pmr">here</a>. <br>

 <br>
 <a name="eight"></a><u>Safety (Category 8)</u><br>
Two highway safety programs are funded in this category: the Federal Hazard Elimination Program and the Federal Railroad Signal Safety Program. The Hazard Elimination Program can fund projects on all Texas roads. Projects are selected throughout the state using mandatory federal safety criteria. The projects are evaluated using three years of accident data and ranked by the Safety Improvement Index, a federal method of looking at highway safety issues. Funding is divided up by the Texas Transportation Commission based on the criteria and available funds. The Railroad Signal Safety Program funds installation of automatic railroad warning devices at hazardous railroad crossings on all Texas roads. Projects are selected from a statewide list which is prioritized by the Railroad Crossing Index. Several criteria make up the index including: number of trains per day, train speed, traffic, type of existing warning device, train-involved accidents within the last five years, and more.

              <p><a name="two"></a><u>Metropolitan Area (TMA) Corridor Projects (Category 2)</u><br>
 Large metropolitan areas in our state with populations greater than 200,000
 have several areas that contain high levels of traffic, or corridors. The roads
 in these areas of congestion may not be capable of minimizing traffic as they
 are currently built. Corridor projects in this category are mobility and/or
 added capacity projects on major state highway system corridors which serve
 the mobility needs of large population centers. These corridor projects are
 selected by the Texas Transportation Commission statewide based on a formula. For more detail on the Metropolitan Area Corridor Projects category, click <a href="SMP.Detail.htm#macp">here</a>. <br>

 Medium-to-small population centers (50,000–200,000) in our state have areas
 of high traffic and congestion that needs to be managed efficiently. Corridor
 projects in this category are mobility and/or added capacity projects on major
 state highway system corridors which serve the mobility needs of these smaller
 urban areas. These corridor projects are selected by the Texas Transportation
 Commission statewide based on a formula. For more detail on the Urban Area Corridor Projects category, click <a href="SMP.Detail.htm#uacp">here</a>. <br>

				  <p><a name="four"></a><u>Statewide Connectivity Corridor Projects (Category 4)</u><br>
 Mobility and/or added capacity projects on major state highway system corridors
 that improve the highway connections between large urban areas are funded in
 this category. Project types can include maintaining trade corridors along the
 Interstate Highway System, for example I-10, or major roads from the border
 region to urban areas in the state. These corridor projects are selected by
 the Texas Transportation Commission statewide based on a formula. For more detail on the Statewide Connectivity Corridor Projects category, click <a href="SMP.Detail.htm#sccp">here</a>. <br>
			(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>
			<p><a name="five"></a><u>Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (Category 5)</u><br>
 These projects, commonly referred to as CMAQ projects, work to meet federal
 air quality standards in areas of the state where air pollution fails to meet
 the standard. Funds cannot be used to add road capacity for driver-only vehicles.
 The Texas Transportation Commission allocates funding in this category based
 upon the population in the affected areas weighted by how severe the air quality
 problem is in the area. Projects are selected by Metropolitan Planning Organizations
 (MPOs) in consultation with TxDOT and the <a href="http://www.tceq.org/" target="_blank">Texas
 Commission on Environmental Quality </a> (TCEQ). For more detail on the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement category, click <a href="SMP.Detail.htm#cmaq">here</a>. <br>

			  <p><a name="nine"></a><u>Transportation Enhancements (Category 9)</u><br>
 Adding value to our driving experiences on Texas roads is the goal of this category.
 Types of enhancement projects include landscaping, bicycle and pedestrian facilities,
 historic preservation sites, and improving the scenic quality of roads. Category
 funds increase the normal funding of enhancement projects on roads served by
 TxDOT. Projects are recommended by local governments, reviewed and recommended
 by committee, and then selected by the Texas Transportation Commission. For more detail on the Transportation Enhancements category, click <a href="SMP.Detail.htm#te">here</a>. <br>

			<p><a name="ten"></a><u>Supplemental Transportation Program (Category 10)</u><br>
 Seven individual programs make up this category: State Park Roads, the Railroad
 Grade Crossing Replanking Program, the Railroad Signal Maintenance Program,
 Construction Landscape Programs, and miscellaneous Federal programs the state
 may choose to participate in.
<ul>
	<li> The State Parks Roads projects are selected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife
 Department for the construction and rehabilitation of roadways within or near
 state parks, fish hatcheries, and other wildlife areas.</li>
	<li> The Railroad Grade Crossing Replanking Program replaces rough railroad
	  crossing surfaces on roads maintained by TxDOT. Approximately 140 installations
	  on rail crossings are conducted statewide per year.</li>
	<li> The Railroad Signal Maintenance Program contributes funding to each railroad
	  company to maintain rail signals based on the number of crossings on state
	  roads and the type of automatic signals at each crossing.</li>
	<li> The Construction Landscape Program funds new landscape development projects
	  such as right-of-way landscape development, rest area/picnic area landscape
	  development, and erosion control on roads maintained by TxDOT. These projects
	  are selected at the TxDOT district level. </li>
	<li> The Landscape Cost Sharing Program allows TxDOT to negotiate and implement
	  landscape development projects through partnerships with local governments
	  with support from civic associations and private groups.</li>
    <li> The Green Ribbon Landscape Improvement Program allows TxDOT to implement
      new landscape development and establishment projects in areas of the state
      that do not meet federal air quality standards. Trees and plants can help
      lessen the effects of air pollution in the areas.</li>
    <li> The Texas Transportation Commission may also approve state participation
      in federal programs such as <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/flh/forest.htm" target="_blank">Forest
      Highways </a>, <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/flh/indresrd.htm" target="_blank">Indian
      Reservation Highways </a>, <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/flh/" target="_blank">Federal
      Lands Highways </a>, and <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/discretionary/fbprinfo.htm" target="_blank">Ferry
      Boat Discretionary </a>. The Supplemental Transportation Projects category
      provides a vehicle for this type of funding.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="eleven"></a><u>District Discretionary (Category 11)</u><br>
 This category allows TxDOT districts to fund miscellaneous projects on roads
 maintained by TxDOT. Some of the funds may be used on county and city roads.
 Projects are selected by the district. The Texas Legislature mandated that each
 TxDOT district receive a minimum of $2.5 million per year in this category.
 Funding above that amount is divided up by formula and approved by the Texas
 Transportation Commission. For more detail on the District Discretionary category, click <a href="SMP.Detail.htm#dd">here</a>. <br>

  <p><a name="twelve"></a><u>Strategic Priority (Category 12)</u><br>
 The Texas Transportation Commission may select projects that promote economic
 development, help Texas roads connect with the same roads in bordering states
 and Mexico , improve roads on military deployment routes, or address other strategic
 needs as determined by the Commission. For more detail on the Strategic Priority category, click <a href="SMP.Detail.htm#sp">here</a>. <br>
