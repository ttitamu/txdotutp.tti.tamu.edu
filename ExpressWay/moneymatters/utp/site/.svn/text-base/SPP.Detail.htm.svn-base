        <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
        <p>This category provides for the preventive maintenance and pavement rehabilitation on the existing State Highway System including installation and rehabilitation of traffic control devices, and the rehabilitation and maintenance of operational traffic management systems. Category 1 is intended for use in rehabilitating pavements on the state highway system. </p>          <strong>Restrictions</strong><strong></strong>
         <p>Preventive Maintenance - This work is intended to preserve, rather than improve, the structural integrity of the pavement and/or structure. Examples of preventive maintenance activities include asphalt concrete pavement (ACP) overlays (2&rdquo; thick maximum); seal coats; cleaning and sealing joints and cracks; patching concrete pavement; shoulder repair; scour countermeasures; cleaning and painting steel members to include application of other coatings; restore drainage systems; cleaning and sealing bridge joints; micro-surfacing; bridge deck protection; milling or bituminous level-up; clean, lubricate and reset bearings; and clean rebar/strand and patch structural concrete and seal cracks. </p>
        <p>Rehabilitation - This category funds can be expended on any highway on the state highway system, and are intended for the rehabilitation (including approved preventive maintenance measures) of existing main lanes, structures and frontage roads. </p>
        <p>Funds expended on the Interstate Highway system can also be used to build interchanges, high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes or auxiliary lanes on Interstate highways with prior approval by the Transportation Planning and Programming Division Director; however, funds cannot be used to add lanes for single occupancy vehicles (SOVs). </p>
        <p>This category also addresses the replacement and refurbishing of signs and their appurtenances, raised reflective pavement markers and thermoplastic striping on Interstate highways. </p>
        <p>This category is also used to address the installation and/or rehabilitation signs, pavement markings, traffic signals, and illumination systems, including minor roadway modifications to improve operations. Funds can be used to install new traffic signals as well as modernize existing signals. The normal installation of signing and markers through construction projects and maintenance operations is not considered eligible for this category. </p>
        <p>This category may also be used to address the rehabilitation and maintenance of operational traffic management systems. Funds used in this manner can only be spent on contractor payments (including parts and labor) which are contracted through either the construction or General Services (i.e., catalog procurement) process. The purchase of spare parts, test equipment and other materials that will be installed by TxDOT forces are not eligible. </p>
        <p>All projects must be developed in accordance with applicable federal and state environmental requirements. All projects must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with state laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design and construction standards as required by TEA-21. </p>
        <p>Projects in this category must have the concurrence of the MPO if it is located in their area of jurisdiction. </p>
        <p><strong>Project Selection</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Allocations for the Preventive Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program are approved by the commission, with the districts receiving allocations based on the following formula: </p>

        <p><strong><a name="srr"></a>STRUCTURES  REHABILITATION AND REPLACEMENT </strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Description</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Category 6 is to address the replacement or rehabilitation of deficient existing bridges located on the public highways, roads and streets in the state and the construction of grade separations at existing highway-railroad grade crossings, and the rehabilitation of deficient railroad underpasses on the state highway system. </p>
        <p><strong>Restrictions</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Bridge projects must meet eligibility criteria including: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1. Being classified as functionally or structurally deficient under FHWA criteria; </p>
          <p>2. Having a FHWA sufficiency rating less than 50 to be eligible for replacement, or having and FHWA sufficiency rating less that 80 to be eligible for rehabilitation. </p>
        </blockquote>        <p>All bridge replacements and rehabilitation must be in accordance with TxDOT's design standards. </p>
        <p>The railroad grade separation projects must be at an existing highway-railroad grade crossing and replace or rehabilitate an existing deficient railroad underpass on the state highway system. The on state highway roadway must have a functional classification greater than a local road or rural minor collector. </p>
        <p>All projects in this category must have the concurrence of the MPO if located within their area of jurisdiction. These projects must be developed in accordance with the applicable state or federal environmental requirements. They must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with state laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design and construction standards as required by TEA-21. </p>
        <p><strong>Project Selection</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>The Bridge Division ranks, prioritizes and makes project selection recommendations to the commission. The commission approves all projects for this category. On and off-state system bridge projects are selected using a statewide prioritization process that utilizes a calculated score for each candidate bridge. These score considers average daily traffic, cost per vehicle, bridge condition, adequacy of roadway width and overall bridge sufficiency. The actual scoring process is referred to as the Texas Eligible Bridge Selection System (TEBSS). However, projects involving eligible candidate bridges that are appraised by TxDOT as having a &ldquo;critical condition&rdquo; may be selected regardless of the TEBSS score. Railroad grade separation projects are selected using a statewide prioritization process that utilizes a cost-benefit index (CBI). This CBI considers average daily traffic, number of fatalities and injuries, and delay to vehicle traffic. </p>
        <p>For off-state highway system bridge projects selected under the statewide prioritization process, consideration may be given under certain circumstances to a local government&rsquo;s preference to fund a substitution project. TxDOT staff will consider the justification of each proposed substitution on a case-by-case basis and prepare specific minute orders for commission action as appropriate. </p>
        <p><strong>Policy</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Match for preliminary engineering, construction, and right-of-way purchase/utility adjustments will be in accordance with TxDOT's Policy for Matching Funds - Participation Ratios. </p>
        <p><strong>Levels of Authority</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>CONSTRUCT - Projects authorized for complete PS&amp;E preparation, right-of-way acquisition, utility adjustments and construction letting. (Current year plus the next ten years). The Bridge Division will review the potential bridge projects, authorize their letting and monitor the TxDOT districts&rsquo; ability to reach their letting targets shown on the summary page of Exhibit C.</p>
